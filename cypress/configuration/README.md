# Configuration

Files we write global configuration - a configuration used by many other files. 

In these files we will store everything that is configurable like for example:

- browser URL Cypress going to open and visit during tests

We wanna make sure that configuration files are stored in one place and then used in many places by other parts of the app. Later if there's a need to change something, we will change only in these configuration files.
